             <p id="text">These are few of my favorite <a href="https://leaders.com/articles/personal-growth/jordan-peterson-quotes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quote </a>from him :</p>
             <p class="quote">“Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.”</p>
             <p class="quote">“You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with (and then resentful, and then vengeful, and then worse).”</p>
             <p class="quote">“So, listen, to yourself and to those with whom you are speaking. Your wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom.”</p>
