            <p><b>Nb:</b> This is just a very short summary of this brilliant man's achievement for the purpose of this projects I will not go into details but the info can be found <a href="https://populartimelines.com/timeline/Jordan-Peterson" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a></p><br>
            <p>these are few of my favorite quote from him:</p>
            <p class="quote">“Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.”</p>
            <p class="quote">“You must determine where you are going in your life, <br>because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. <br>It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and <br>hard to get along with (and then resentful, and then vengeful, and then worse).”</p>
            <p class="quote">“So, listen, to yourself and to those with whom you are speaking. <br>Your wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual search for knowledge,<br> which is the highest form of wisdom.”</p>
